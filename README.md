### Overview

HYPE3.cool is a decentralized platform focused on solving income distribution challenges for IP creators. By leveraging the Solana blockchain, it provides tools for tokenizing IP, automating licensing, and enabling real-time revenue tracking and royalty payments. The HYPE3.cool API allows developers to interact with the platform’s core functionalities, including managing IP assets, accessing licensed data for AI training, and integrating with the IPfi ecosystem.This repository contains the source code and documentation for the HYPE3.cool API, designed to support developers building applications for IP management and monetization.

### Features
- **IP Tokenization**: Create and manage tokenized intellectual property on Solana.
- **Programmable Licensing**: Automate licensing agreements for IP assets.
- **Revenue Distribution**: Enable real-time tracking and automated royalty payments.
- **AI Integration**: Provide a standardized interface for AI models to access licensed IP data.
- **No-Code Support**: Facilitate integration with HYPE3.cool’s no-code IP agency platform.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Built on Solana for high throughput and low transaction costs.

### Installation

1. To get started with the HYPE3.cool API, follow these steps:Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HYPE3-COOL/hype3cool-api.git
   cd hype3cool-api
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:

   Ensure you have Node.js (or the relevant runtime environment) installed. Then, install the required dependencies:bash

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the API:

   Start the API server:bash
   
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Usage

   The HYPE3.cool API allows you to interact with the platform’s on-chain IP agent framework. Below is an example of how to authenticate and make a request to tokenize an IP asset:

   ```bash
   const axios = require('axios');
   
   const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/ip/tokenize', {
     assetId: 'your-asset-id',
     creatorAddress: 'your-solana-wallet-address',
     licensingTerms: { ... }
   }, {
     headers: {
       Authorization: `Bearer ${yourApiKey}`
     }
   });

   console.log(response.data);
   ```
   Note: Replace this example with actual API usage details if available.
